Let’s face it, as developers, we’ve all written code that breaks. Sometimes spectacularly. And when it does, our first instinct isn’t always to debug. No, first we reach for our **arsenal of excuses.**

In the spirit of honesty (and humor), here are the top 10 excuses developers give when things go wrong… and the **real reasons** behind the chaos.

### 10. “It Works on My Machine”

**Translation:** I’m not sure what you did, but it’s definitely not *my* fault.

**Example:**  
You ship an Angular app. QA opens it and boom, blank screen. You shrug, “Works fine here.”

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
You forgot to add an environment variable or dependency to the Docker image / `.env` file. Your local machine has cached credentials, but the build pipeline does not. 

**Takeaway:**  
Test like a stranger using your code for the first time. Use clean environments or CI/CD staging builds for validation.

---

### 9. “Must Be a Browser Issue”

**Translation:** This browser has personally offended me. Let’s blame it.

**Example:**  
The UI looks broken in Safari. Elements are overlapping and styles are ignored.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
You used `flex-gap`, which Safari only started supporting in version 14+. Or maybe forgot a vendor prefix.

**Takeaway:**  
Check compatibility on [Can I use](https://caniuse.com/), use consistent CSS resets, and test on actual target browsers (even the cursed ones).

---

### 8. “The API Must Be Down”

**Translation:** It’s probably the backend’s fault. I’m just the messenger.

**Example:**  
Your frontend app shows a spinning loader indefinitely. You hit refresh. Nothing.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
The API is returning a 500 because you passed `undefined` as a required field. The API *is* up it’s just angry.

**Takeaway:**  
Always log and inspect request/response payloads. Use tools like Postman or browser dev tools for quick sanity checks.

---

### 7. “I Swear I Didn’t Touch That Part of the Code”

**Translation:** The butterfly effect is real in software.

**Example:**  
You update a CSS class name in one component. Suddenly another modal stops working.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
You renamed a shared utility class or global style, assuming it was only used in your component.

**Takeaway:**  
When working in shared codebases, **assume nothing is isolated** unless it explicitly is. Use scoped styles, modular patterns, and unit tests.

---

### 6. “It’s a Caching Issue”

**Translation:** I don’t know what’s wrong, but clearing cache usually helps.

**Example:**  
The client swears they can’t see the latest changes, even though you deployed 10 minutes ago.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
Your app uses aggressive service worker caching. Or your CDN is serving stale assets. Or your `index.html` has a hardcoded version number.

**Takeaway:**  
Implement cache busting with hashed filenames. Understand how service workers behave. Sometimes a “clear site data” is a necessary evil.

---

### 5. “That Bug Was Already There”

**Translation:** Blame it on the ancestors.

**Example:**  
User form validations are broken. You’re asked why.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
Yes, the bug was *technically* there but your new field exposed it by breaking the logic inside a 4-year-old legacy function called `handleEverything()`.

**Takeaway:**  
Own the outcome, even if you didn’t write the original mess. Codebases are like archaeology you dig, you learn, you patch.

---

### 4. “That’s Just a Warning, Not an Error”

**Translation:** If the app compiles, it deploys.

**Example:**  
Console is full of red text. You say, “Don’t worry, those are just warnings.”

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
The warnings were about deprecations, type mismatches, and possible memory leaks. Then something *actually* breaks because of them.

**Takeaway:**  
Treat warnings like early indicators of future bugs. Don’t ship apps with noisy logs, they’re code smells.

---

### 3. “It’s Just a One-Line Change”

![Remove Line]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/gifs/remove-line.gif)

**Translation:** I didn’t test it, but how bad could it be?

**Example:**  
You change one variable name to "improve clarity." The app crashes.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
That “one line” was imported across 14 files, passed through a state manager, and controlled a database flag.

**Takeaway:**  
There is no such thing as a truly isolated one-line change. Always test after even the smallest commits.

---

### 2. “Git Must’ve Messed It Up”

**Translation:** Blame the tool everyone uses.

**Example:**  
The build fails, files are missing, or changes look wrong. “It’s Git,” you say.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
You force-pushed without pulling. Or committed to the wrong branch. Or resolved a merge conflict by deleting someone else’s work.

**Takeaway:**  
Git is powerful and dangerous. Treat it with respect. Use clear commit messages, review diffs, and never `git push --force` without understanding the consequences.

---

### 1. “It Was Working Yesterday”

**Translation:** Time is a flat circle, and I’m confused.

**Example:**  
The entire app crashes on startup. “But I didn’t touch anything!” you insist.

**What Actually Went Wrong:**  
A dependency auto-updated overnight, your API key expired, or a cron job you forgot existed ran a destructive query.

**Takeaway:**  
Software doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Track changes. Pin versions. Log everything. And accept that “yesterday” is a lie in the land of code.

---

### Bonus Excuse: “It’s a Feature, Not a Bug”

**Translation:** I'm too tired to fix this. Let's pretend it was intentional.

## Final Thoughts

We’ve all used these excuses and honestly, sometimes they *are* valid. But the difference between a seasoned dev and a junior isn’t whether things break, it’s how quickly and responsibly we debug them.

So next time your app misbehaves, take a deep breath, open your logs, and maybe just maybe resist the urge to blame Safari.
