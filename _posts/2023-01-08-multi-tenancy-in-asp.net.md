## Introduction to Multi-Tenancy
Multi-tenancy is a software architecture in which a single instance of a software application serves multiple customers, also known as tenants. Each tenant has its own separate database, and the application is customized for each tenant based on their specific needs and requirements.

Multi-tenancy allows for economies of scale, as the cost of maintaining and updating the software is shared among all the tenants. It also allows for more efficient resource utilization, as the software can be used by multiple tenants at the same time.

There are two main types of multi-tenancy:

1. Shared database: In this approach, all tenants share the same database, and each tenant's data is stored in a separate schema within the database.

2. Separate database: In this approach, each tenant has its own separate database, and the application is installed and configured separately for each tenant.

## Implementing Multi-Tenancy in ASP.NET
There are several approaches to implementing multi-tenancy in an ASP.NET application. Here are three common approaches:

### 1. Using a Tenant Identifier in the URL
In this approach, the tenant identifier is included in the URL of the application. For example, the URL for tenant 1 might be http://myapp.com/tenant1, and the URL for tenant 2 might be http://myapp.com/tenant2.

To implement this approach, you can create a custom route in the application that includes the tenant identifier as a parameter. The custom route can then be used to load the appropriate tenant data and configure the application accordingly.

Here is an example of how you might implement a custom route in an ASP.NET MVC application:
```csharp
public class TenantRoute : Route
{
    public TenantRoute(string url, IRouteHandler routeHandler)
        : base(url, routeHandler)
    {
    }

    public TenantRoute(string url, RouteValueDictionary defaults, IRouteHandler routeHandler)
        : base(url, defaults, routeHandler)
    {
    }

    public TenantRoute(string url, RouteValueDictionary defaults, RouteValueDictionary constraints, IRouteHandler routeHandler)
        : base(url, defaults, constraints, routeHandler)
    {
    }

    public TenantRoute(string url, RouteValueDictionary defaults, RouteValueDictionary constraints, RouteValueDictionary dataTokens, IRouteHandler routeHandler)
        : base(url, defaults, constraints, dataTokens, routeHandler)
    {
    }

    public override VirtualPathData GetVirtualPath(RequestContext requestContext, RouteValueDictionary values)
    {
        // Check if the tenant identifier is included in the route values
        if (values.ContainsKey("tenant"))
        {
            // Get the tenant identifier
            string tenant = values["tenant"] as string;

            // Remove the tenant identifier from the route values
            values.Remove("tenant");

            // Set the tenant identifier as the first segment of the URL
            return new VirtualPathData(this, tenant + "/" + base.GetVirtualPath(requestContext, values).VirtualPath);
        }

        return base.GetVirtualPath(requestContext, values);
    }
}
```
To register the custom route, you can use the following code in the __*Application__Start*__ method of the __*Global.asax*__ file:
```csharp
RouteTable.Routes.Add(new TenantRoute("{tenant}/{controller}/{action}/{id}", new MvcRouteHandler())
{
    Defaults = new RouteValueDictionary(new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional })
});
```
With this custom route in place, you can access the tenant identifier in the action methods of your controllers by using the __*RouteData*__ object. For example:
```csharp
public ActionResult Index()
{
    string tenant = RouteData.Values["tenant"] as string;
    // Load tenant data and configure the application accordingly
    ...
    return View();
}
```

### 2. Using a Custom Claim in the User Identity
In this approach, the tenant identifier is stored as a custom claim in the user's identity. This approach is useful if you want to store the tenant identifier in the user's session, so that the user does not have to specify the tenant in the URL for every request.

To implement this approach, you can create a custom __*ClaimsIdentity*__ class that includes a custom claim for the tenant identifier. Here is an example of how you might implement a custom __*ClaimsIdentity*__ class:
```csharp
public class TenantClaimsIdentity : ClaimsIdentity
{
    public TenantClaimsIdentity(IEnumerable<Claim> claims, string authenticationType)
        : base(claims, authenticationType)
    {
    }

    public TenantClaimsIdentity(IEnumerable<Claim> claims, string authenticationType, string nameType, string roleType)
        : base(claims, authenticationType, nameType, roleType)
    {
    }

    public string Tenant
    {
        get
        {
            Claim claim = this.FindFirst("tenant");
            return claim != null ? claim.Value : null;
        }
    }
}
```
To use the custom __*ClaimsIdentity*__ class, you can create a custom __*ClaimsPrincipal*__ class that derives from __*ClaimsPrincipal*__ and overrides the CreateIdentity method. Here is an example of how you might implement a custom __*ClaimsPrincipal*__ class:
```csharp
public class TenantClaimsPrincipal : ClaimsPrincipal
{
    public TenantClaimsPrincipal(IIdentity identity)
        : base(identity)
    {
    }

    public TenantClaimsPrincipal(IEnumerable<ClaimsIdentity> identities)
        : base(identities)
    {
    }

    public static new TenantClaimsPrincipal Create(IIdentity identity)
    {
        return new TenantClaimsPrincipal(identity);
    }

    public static new TenantClaimsPrincipal Create(IEnumerable<ClaimsIdentity> identities)
    {
        return new TenantClaimsPrincipal(identities);
    }
}
```
To store the tenant identifier in the user's session, you can use the __*SessionSecurityTokenHandler*__ class to create a session token that includes the tenant identifier as a custom claim. Here is an example of how you might do this:
```csharp
// Create a custom session token with a tenant claim
List<Claim> claims = new List<Claim>
{
    new Claim("tenant", "tenant1")
};
SessionSecurityToken token = new SessionSecurityToken(new TenantClaimsIdentity(claims, "Custom"));

// Save the session token in the user's session
SessionAuthenticationModule module = FederatedAuthentication.SessionAuthenticationModule;
module.WriteSessionTokenToCookie(token);
```
To access the tenant identifier in the action methods of your controllers, you can use the __*Tenant*__ property of the __*TenantClaimsPrincipal*__ class. For example:
```csharp
public ActionResult Index()
{
    TenantClaimsPrincipal principal = User as TenantClaimsPrincipal;
    string tenant = principal.Tenant;
    // Load tenant data and configure the application accordingly
    ...
    return View();
}
```

### 3. Using a Custom Tenant Resolver
In this approach, you can create a custom tenant resolver that determines the tenant for each request based on some logic. This approach is useful if you want to use a different approach to determine the tenant, such as by reading a header value or a cookie value.

To implement this approach, you can create a custom tenant resolver class that implements the __*ITenantResolver*__ interface. The __*ITenantResolver*__ interface has a single method, __*ResolveTenantId*__, that takes a __*HttpContextBase*__ object as a parameter and returns a string containing the tenant identifier.

Here is an example of how you might implement the __*ITenantResolver*__ interface:
```csharp
public interface ITenantResolver
{
    string ResolveTenantId(HttpContextBase context);
}

public class CustomTenantResolver : ITenantResolver
{
    public string ResolveTenantId(HttpContextBase context)
    {
        // Implement custom logic to determine the tenant based on the request context
        ...
        return tenant;
    }
}
```
To use the custom tenant resolver, you can create a custom action filter attribute that resolves the tenant for each request and stores it in the __*RouteData*__ object. Here is an example of how you might implement the custom action filter attribute:
```csharp
public class TenantFilterAttribute : ActionFilterAttribute
{
    private ITenantResolver tenantResolver;

    public TenantFilterAttribute(ITenantResolver tenantResolver)
    {
        this.tenantResolver = tenantResolver;
    }

    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        // Resolve the tenant for the current request
        string tenant = tenantResolver.ResolveTenantId(filterContext.HttpContext);

        // Store the tenant in the RouteData object
        filterContext.RouteData.Values["tenant"] = tenant;

        base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext);
    }
}
```
To apply the custom action filter attribute to a controller or action method, you can use the __*[TenantFilter]*__ attribute. For example:
```csharp
[TenantFilter]
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        // The tenant is stored in the RouteData object
        string tenant = RouteData.Values["tenant"] as string;
        // Load tenant data and configure the application accordingly
        ...
        return View();
    }
}
```

## Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed three approaches to implementing multi-tenancy in an ASP.NET application: using a tenant identifier in the URL, using a custom claim in the user identity, and using a custom tenant resolver. Each approach has its own benefits and trade-offs, and the appropriate approach will depend on your specific requirements and constraints.
