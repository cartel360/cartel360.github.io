I’m a software engineer who thrives on clean code, coffee, and conquering challenges (usually in that order). I’ve spent my time optimizing algorithms, debugging mysteries, and creating systems that—let’s face it—usually work just as expected (except when they don’t, and then I’ve got a few witty excuses ready).

Whether it's building scalable backend solutions, crafting responsive frontends, or untangling the knots of legacy code, I live for the thrill of solving problems (and sometimes creating them—just to see what happens). I specialize in Python, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, Dart, PHP, SQL, .NET, Flutter, Django, Angular, Firebase and I am a proud advocate of continuous learning because, let’s be honest, who really understands quantum computing on the first try?

When I’m not busy refactoring code, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, obsessing over minimalistic UI design, playing video games and pondering the deeper questions of life like: ‘Why doesn’t my CSS work in Internet Explorer?’ and ‘Is the cloud just someone else’s computer?’

Need someone to create scalable systems that run smoother than a fresh pull request? troubleshoot like a detective, and do it all with a sense of humor that borders on the too sarcastic side, I’m your developer. Just don’t ask me to fix your printer, that’s beyond even my powers.

> Code is poetry. And sometimes, I write a haiku. Other times, it’s more like an epic saga that ends with me crying at 3 AM and a GitHub issue that reads: ‘Works, but don’t ask how'
